<h1>cURL extension is required</h1>
<p>The Memberful plugin needs a PHP extension called <a href="http://uk1.php.net/curl">cURL</a> so that it can fetch your members, and their subscriptions from <a href="https://memberful.com">Memberful.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you're running WordPress on the internet, then you should ask your webhost to install it - they should know what it is and how to do it.</p>
<p>If you're using <a href="http://wampserver.com">WampServer</a> on Windows then left click the icon, go to "PHP Extensions" and click the cURL option.</p>
